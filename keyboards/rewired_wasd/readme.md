This is my rewired WASD keyboard.

I really like the form factor and build quality of the WASD Code line, but I
was not very keen on the lack of configurability.  So I took out the original
keyboard controller, reverse engineered the keyboard matrix, then soldered a teensy
in its place and used qmk to get an infinitely more configurable keyboard that
you can do anything you want with.
